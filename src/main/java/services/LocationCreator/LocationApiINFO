    * Incident solar radiation is the most important parameter for the power generated by solar energy systems.
    * sun changes its position during the day from morning to night. Moreover, the sun orbit differs from one season to another.
    * By properly following the sun, through utilizing sun tracking systems, the incident solar irradiance can be effectively increased [72].
    * A sun tracker is an electromechanic component used for orienting a solar photovoltaic panel, concentrating solar reflector, or lens toward the sun.
    * Solar panels require a high degree of accuracy to ensure that the concentrated sunlight is directed precisely to the photovoltaic device.
    * solar tracking systems can substantially improve the amount of power produced by a system by enhancing morning and afternoon performance.
    * For instance, the orientation of PV panels can increase the solar-electric energy conversion totalEfficiency between 20% and 50% [73–77].
    * A fixed system oriented to a fixed sun facing direction will have a relatively low annual
    * production because they do not move to track the sun which yields significant increase of incident irradiation.
    * An efficient sun tracking system should be capable of movement from north to south and from east to west as shown in Fig. 2.10.
